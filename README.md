Working on my python skills

Numbers
---------

[**Fibonacci Sequence**](https://github.com/Heugal/martyr2-mega-project/blob/master/numbers/fibonacci.py) - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.

[**Change Return Program**](https://github.com/Heugal/martyr2-mega-project/blob/master/numbers/change.py) - The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies needed for the change.

[**Binary to Decimal and Back Converter**](https://github.com/Heugal/martyr2-mega-project/blob/master/numbers/binconverter.py) - Develop a converter to convert a decimal number to binary or a binary number to its decimal equivalent.

[**Calculator**](https://github.com/Heugal/martyr2-mega-project/blob/master/numbers/calc.py) - A simple calculator to do basic operators. Make it a scientific calculator for added complexity.

Text
---------

[**Palindrome**](https://github.com/Heugal/martyr2-mega-project/blob/master/text/palindrome.py) - User enters a string and the program returns a palindrome.

[**Pig Latin**](https://github.com/Heugal/martyr2-mega-project/blob/master/text/piglatin.py) - User enters a string and the program translates it into pig latin.

[**Reverse String**](https://github.com/Heugal/martyr2-mega-project/blob/master/text/reverseString.py) - User enters a string and the program reverses it.

[**Ceaser cipher encrypt**](https://github.com/Heugal/martyr2-mega-project/blob/master/text/caesar.py) - User enters a file and the program encrypts the text using a Caesar cipher.

[**Caesar cipher decrypt**](https://github.com/Heugal/martyr2-mega-project/blob/master/text/decrypt.py) - User enters a Caesar cipher encrypted file and the program decrypts it.
